# Config
Shared configs across systems

## Usage
I tend to clone locally and link as needed. ie load via `.emacs` file.

## Emacs
.el files are included for convenience, so I can just clone and go, but changes go in the `.org` files which use babel-tangle to generate the `.el` files.

Yeah there's personal filepaths and preferences (RSS feeds), but nothing sensitive...
